# Backend API base URL (no trailing slash)
# Local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Railway deployment: replace the value above with your Railway backend URL, e.g.:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://masaad-backend-production.up.railway.app
#
# The variable is embedded at build time by Next.js. After changing it you must
# rebuild the frontend (npm run build / Railway will do this automatically on
# each deploy if the variable is set in the Railway service environment).
